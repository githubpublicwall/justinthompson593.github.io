\textbf{Problem 2 / 3} [10pt]: Finish the following function. For input: $f$ is \textbf{a} function so that $f(x_j)$ returns the value of \textbf{an} interpolating polynomial at $x_j$ and $x$ is a row vector of values. For output: $y$ is a row vector of the values $f(x_j)$ for each element in $x$. Assume that $f(x_j)$ only accepts \textit{one value at a time}.\\

\textbf{function} y = evaluateF($f$, $x$)\\

Okay. This is a \textit{very} tricky problem. When I sat down to take this exam, I almost missed this one completely. In the previous problem, you either wrote the function $f(x)$ as a linear system (A1 / A2) or you found a Lagrangian polynomial named $f(x)$  (B1 / B2). In any case, you've done a lot of work to accurately describe $f(x)$. If this problem were stated like this \\
\\

\textbf{Problem 2 / 3} [10pt]: Finish the following MATLAB function named "evaluateF." For input: $g$ is a function so that $g(t_j)$ returns the value of \textbf{an} interpolating polynomial at $t_j$ and $t$ is a row vector of values. For output: $y$ is a row vector of the values $g(t_j)$ for each element in $t$. Assume that $g(x_j)$ only accepts one value at a time.
